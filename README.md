The buzzword of the neurological world this days is neuroplasticity. Long gone are the days where we thought that once you reach your forties, fifties at best, the only way is downhill. It is now a recognized fact that your brain is continuously developing, creating new neurological connexions and pruning unused pathways. 

But keeping your brain in top working condition requires some work. While the idea of learning a new language, playing a new instrument or even starting coding later in life is certainly aspirational, finding the time in today’s busy world may not be easily achievable.

That is where simple, easy brain  games can make a difference. In particular, memory games that require the player to concentrate and pay attention can help to improve and maintain cognitive abilities. They target short term memory which, in turn, can help maintain long term memory.

Lucella card match is a basic card matching game. A set of cards will be laid down on the board and, turning only one pair of cards at a time, the player needs to eliminate cards by matching pairs correctly. The game finishes when all the board is empty.

Although the game will use cards based on the characters of the series “Piggy before the infection started” to appeal to the series’ followers, it will be just as easily played by anybody, young and old alike.
