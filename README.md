The buzzword of the neurological world this days is neuroplasticity. Long gone are the days where we thought that once you reach your forties, fifties at best, the only way is downhill. It is now a recognized fact that your brain is continuously developing, creating new neurological connexions and pruning unused pathways. 

But keeping your brain in top working condition requires some work. While the idea of learning a new language, playing a new instrument or even starting coding later in life is certainly aspirational, finding the time in today’s busy world may not be easily achievable.

That is where simple, easy brain  games can make a difference. In particular, memory games that require the player to concentrate and pay attention can help to improve and maintain cognitive abilities. They target short term memory which, in turn, can help maintain long term memory.

Lucella card match is a basic card matching game. A set of cards will be laid down on the board and, turning only one pair of cards at a time, the player needs to eliminate cards by matching pairs correctly. The game finishes when all the board is empty.

Although the game will use cards based on the characters of the series “Piggy before the infection started” to appeal to the series’ followers, it will be just as easily played by anybody, young and old alike.

## Design.

Lucella card matching is a simple card matching games. The player will be able to choose a board made of 4 x 3, 4 x 4 or 5 x 5 cards turned upside down. By uncovering two cards at a time, the player needs to find matching pairs of cards. Each time a pair is matched, it disappears until the board is empty. 

On loading the game, the player will be presented with a home page.  By clicking on the play button, an option to choose the appropriate level of challenge will appear. This will lead to the desired game page.

The game pages will contain the main board for the game. A link to go back to the home page will be provided, as well as a toggle to get rid of sound effects. A timer will count the time it takes for the board to be emptied. A reset button will be provided.
Once the board is empty, a congratulations message will appear. 

All pages will contain a section with a link to the Piggy Before the Infection Started home page and a rate the game feature.

On clicking on the rate the game, a window will appear so that players can rate the game and give feedback.
